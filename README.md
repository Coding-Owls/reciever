# Proximity Marketing App- Beaconer
>This project focuses on proximity marketing, enhancing the marketing capabilities and reach of merchants by displaying relevant promos, new launches, and other information on any product or service. The buyers receive the promotions on their smartphone using this app.
### This project is based on:
* Flutter based app using Beacon:  The buyers's variant of app detects ibeacon data packets while passing nearby a sender and displays the promotion, service etc. Buyer will receive promotions from multiple merchants subsequently as they pass near one merchant to another. Promotions will be fetched continuously from a cloud database.
