# Proximity Marketing App- Beaconer
>This project focuses on proximity marketing, enhancing the marketing capabilities and reach of merchants by displaying relevant promos, new launches, and other information on any product or service.
### This project is based on:
* Flutter based app using Beacon:  The merchant’s variant of the app will continuously transmit low energy ibeacon data packets and any smartphone passing nearby will detect the data packets and display the promotion, service etc.  Multiple smartphones will be able to display the promotions at the same time. Promotions will be fetched continuously from a cloud database.
